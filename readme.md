# ToyDB

I'm learning how to build a database.

But I don't want to write it in C, so I'm using Rust.

The result is going to be a terrible database. Avert your eyes!

## Approach

I'm taking this approach, but ignoring all the code and reimplementing it in
Rust from scratch:

Once I've done that, I'll likely rewrite the entire thing using what I've
learned + what I can understand from more reading, to be better.
